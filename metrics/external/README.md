Every month, the blog receives around 25,000 visitors from only organic search queries, i.e., do not come from advertisements. The search-visit analysis also shows that there are no paid advertising campaigns for the sample site, and thus, all traffic comes from organic search queries. This is consistent with their statements on their blog.

## Search Engagement

The pages visited per session are also typical for a blog post. However, new visitors looking for a specific recipe usually don't browse for other categories or recipes. Their subscribers typically arrive at the blog via the RSS feed and only read through the current post without reading any other posts since they have already read about them in advance. Very few people browse directly through the "cluttered blog." Browsing is mainly done on social media such as Instagram and Pinterest, on which it has exceptionally high density of pictures. There, all dishes are displayed in a compact view.

## Channel Analytics

The bounce rate is also typically high for a blog post. It refers to the percentage of callers who generate only a single page view on the pages. In organic search, recipes are usually suggested directly. Accordingly, visitors only read posts related to the searched recipe (91%). The values of social media (78%) and direct searches (69%) are also very high, but to be expected with a blog. After all, another 28% look around the page on average before leaving the homepage.
