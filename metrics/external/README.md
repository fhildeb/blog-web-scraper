Every month, the blog receives around 25,000 visitors from only organic search queries, i.e., do not come from advertisements. The search-visit analysis also shows that there are no paid advertising campaigns for the sample site, and thus, all traffic comes from organic search queries. This is consistent with their statements on their blog.
