The search-visit analysis also shows that there are no paid advertising campaigns for the sample site, and thus, all traffic comes from organic search queries.

The pages visited per session are also typical for a blog post. However, new visitors looking for a specific recipe usually don't browse for other categories or recipes. Their subscribers typically arrive at the blog via the RSS feed and only read through the current post without reading any other posts since they have already read about them in advance. Very few people browse directly through the "cluttered blog." Browsing is mainly done on social media such as Instagram and Pinterest, on which it has exceptionally high density of pictures. There, all dishes are displayed in a compact view.
