# Internal Metrics

> **_NOTE:_** Diagram descriptions might appear in German.

When collecting sample data on the website, the author published only one post, which explains the slight change in the data. Only six new comments were written on the blog at the time of scraping. However, over 600 posts and tons of comments can be used to create some metrics

## Comment Count Prediction

You can see an overview of the number of comments (blue) and the trend (prediction, green), which reflects the average comments per post. The numbers fluctuate enormously. The reason for this is a shallow interaction on the blog and the hosting of contests, in which the interaction increases dramatically. The prediction is, in this case, hardly meaningful.

## Comment Frequency

The majority of posts are in the 0-25 comment range. If we look at the number of comments over the life of her blog,she has an above-average number of comments on some posts. The average number of comments is 9.752, with a mean-variance square of +/- 21.290, unpredictably high.

Especially one post from Nov. 20, 2014, stands out with 320 comments. When looking at the post, it also becomes clear why: it was a raffle announced via social media channels. This can also be seen in other posts with an above-average number of comments.

## Interaction Trendline

The number of comments dropped sharply after January 2018. When we clean the data, it becomes clear how the blog and interaction are evolving. This can also be inferred from the declining blog posts.

The author has created an active and interactive blog over the years, but lately, the number of posts has decreased significantly, as you can see well in the number of blogs and comments.

## Publication Date Measures

The blog posts are written very irregularly. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday stand out clearly, but there is currently no structure. The reason for this is possibly the "wedding" in the management of the blog until 2015, in which she often wrote posts every other weekday.

## External Link Extraction

The external links confirm that she works on her blog very much via affiliate links from Amazon. This is followed by a link to the blog [Kochhelden](https://www.kochhelden.tv/), run by her partner Jens Glatz. Together, the two own Glatz Media GmbH, a joint media company specializing in marketing social media as well as photo and video productions in the area of nutrition and recipes. Of course, both often link to each other, as they work in the same environment and support each other. Connecting to the social media channels and advertising partners is just as often. With Edeka and Galeria-Kaufhof, she links to grocery chains. Viewing the total number, however, she connects most blogs from the same subject area- forming a stronger interest bubble.

## Post Category Analysis

As seen in the chart, the categories of the blog posts are very distributed. The owner definitely wants to be able to offer a large variety. Thus a more significant amount of potential customers can be covered. However, it should be said that their main posts belong to several categories at once, which is why there is an expected rash in the type "General."
