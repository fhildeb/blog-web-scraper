# Internal Metrics

> **_NOTE:_** Diagram descriptions might appear in German.

When collecting sample data on the website, the author published only one post, which explains the slight change in the data. Only six new comments were written on the blog at the time of scraping. However, over 600 posts and tons of comments can be used to create some metrics

## Comment Count Prediction

You can see an overview of the number of comments (blue) and the trend (prediction, green), which reflects the average comments per post. The numbers fluctuate enormously. The reason for this is a shallow interaction on the blog and the hosting of contests, in which the interaction increases dramatically. The prediction is, in this case, hardly meaningful.

## Comment Frequency

The majority of posts are in the 0-25 comment range. If we look at the number of comments over the life of her blog,she has an above-average number of comments on some posts. The average number of comments is 9.752, with a mean-variance square of +/- 21.290, unpredictably high.

Especially one post from Nov. 20, 2014, stands out with 320 comments. When looking at the post, it also becomes clear why: it was a raffle announced via social media channels. This can also be seen in other posts with an above-average number of comments.

## Interaction Trendline

The number of comments dropped sharply after January 2018. When we clean the data, it becomes clear how the blog and interaction are evolving. This can also be inferred from the declining blog posts.

The author has created an active and interactive blog over the years, but lately, the number of posts has decreased significantly, as you can see well in the number of blogs and comments.
