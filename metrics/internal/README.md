# Internal Metrics

> **_NOTE:_** Diagram descriptions might appear in German.

When collecting sample data on the website, the author published only one post, which explains the slight change in the data. Only six new comments were written on the blog at the time of scraping. However, over 600 posts and tons of comments can be used to create some metrics

## Comment Count Prediction

![Comment Count Prediction](/img/metrics/sample_analytics_2.png)

You can see an overview of the number of comments (blue) and the trend (prediction, green), which reflects the average comments per post. The numbers fluctuate enormously. The reason for this is a shallow interaction on the blog and the hosting of contests, in which the interaction increases dramatically. The prediction is, in this case, hardly meaningful.
