# Sample Blog Metrics

> **_NOTE:_** Picture description appears in German.

### Timeframe of analytics:

`2nd December 2019 - 27th December 2019`

All metrics and research has been done for the sample blog mentioned in the project's main folder. Roughly half of the blog's metrics are directly derived from the scraped data within the `/data` folder.

## Key Points

Those are directly calculated from scraped data:

- Conversation Rate in `Comments per Post`: 9,75
- Outcome in `Post per Month`: 6,38
- Content Created in `Words per Post`: 880,58

## Blog Value

According to the website [WorthOfWeb](https://www.worthofweb.com/), the blog [Kuechenchaotin](https://kuechenchaotin.de/) is worth 4.281 USD. On the part of [WEBUKA](https://www.webuka.com/), it's only 2,162 USD, according to [WebsiteOutlook](https://www.websiteoutlook.com/), a whole 3,960 USD, pointing at around 3,500 USD on average.

For a blog created in 2012 and with the density of posts, it is a good value but far below what other blogs are worth. The blog [EatThis](https://www.eat-this.org/), to which the sample blog links within the blogroll, was created in 2011 and is even worth 14,650 USD, according to [WebsiteOutlook](https://www.websiteoutlook.com/). This is due to paid search queries and campaigns against which the sample blog has spoken out.
