# Sample Blog Metrics

> **_NOTE:_** Picture description appears in German.

### Timeframe of analytics:

`2nd December 2019 - 27th December 2019`

All metrics and research has been done for the sample blog mentioned in the project's main folder. Roughly half of the blog's metrics are directly derived from the scraped data within the `/data` folder.

## Key Points

Those are directly calculated from scraped data:

- Conversation Rate in `Comments per Post`: 9,75
- Outcome in `Post per Month`: 6,38
- Content Created in `Words per Post`: 880,58

## Blog Value

According to the website [WorthOfWeb](https://www.worthofweb.com/), the blog [Kuechenchaotin](https://kuechenchaotin.de/) is worth 4.281 USD. On the part of [WEBUKA](https://www.webuka.com/), it's only 2,162 USD, according to [WebsiteOutlook](https://www.websiteoutlook.com/), a whole 3,960 USD, pointing at around 3,500 USD on average.

For a blog created in 2012 and with the density of posts, it is a good value but far below what other blogs are worth. The blog [EatThis](https://www.eat-this.org/), to which the sample blog links within the blogroll, was created in 2011 and is even worth 14,650 USD, according to [WebsiteOutlook](https://www.websiteoutlook.com/). This is due to paid search queries and campaigns against which the sample blog has spoken out.

## Applied Business Models

The blog owner offers collaborations in the following forms:

- Sponsored posts and product placements
- Show cooking and lectures at trade fairs and events
- Culinary recipe, event, and travel reviews
- Social media takeovers
- Food and travel photo and video productions
- Recipe developments for companies
- Columns and productions for external magazines
- Production of websites and blogs

Placing ads, in the sense of Google AdSense, the owner does not do. However, personal ads of her books and other reference blogs, within posts, are on her website. Likewise, there is a listing of blogs that she directly promotes, a so-called "blogroll" of the site. Furthermore, there are sponsored posts from time to time. If we look at the target hierarchy, it covers direct sales in the areas of "own market ads," "collaborations," and "affiliate links."

According to the blog's statements, the following things are not used:

- SEO-only collaborations, link purchases, and link exchanges.
- Publications of guest articles or press releases
- Affiliate cooperations
- Collaborations without labeling, etc.
- Non-traditional sales

In her blog section, where the owner talks about the willingness to collaborate, she also sets conditions and boundaries. Collaborations are all meant to support her principle of "maintaining authenticity." If she doesn't find a fair use for the blog or can't identify with the collaboration, it doesn't happen. She includes a link to her books on every page, representing the point of "selling products" in the target hierarchy. So this turnover comes only indirectly through the blog.

## Social Media Communities

The following metrics are referenced on the blog itself, not actual metrics that are calculated within the `./internal` folder.

The author-post metric is evaluated to evaluate if the blog is purposefully run. According to the blog owner's information, she has 535 self-published articles, which provides a rough overview. In the meantime, the blog could grow to over 600 posts. Reader growth is another fundamental building block. The blog references monthly 230,000-page impressions and 166,000 visitors. However, as seen in the internal metrics chapter, that these values have decreased sharply.

The conversation rate is one index of how well interaction and creating posts drive traffic. For their stated 535 posts, there are 5600 comments. So this translates to a conversation rate of 10.47 comments per post, which is also higher than the calculated values in the timeframe.

## Communication Pillars

Roughly, a social media strategy can be divided into the following 4 pillars:

- Goals: What does the blog want to achieve?
- Target: Interacting with the appropriate audience.
- Cannel Selection: Align and distribute interaction on different pages.
- Process Management: Whats necessary? Date, process, type of contribution.

In the next chapter, we will examinate how well they were set up.

## Alignment and Media Design

The blog, with its social media strategy, has the goals of "more reach," "attract new readers," and "connect with their readers." The owner reposts all links to her blog posts in the appropriate format, on the respective social media platforms Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Bloglovin. Thus, new readers looking for cooking tips can find them better and build a conversation directly, following the "Spread the Word principle." Through the blog theme of "Food and Travel," she also clearly defines her target audience. People who love to cook and are looking for cooking tips or travel inspiration.

On Pinterest, there are images for all the posts on her site. Thus, people who only research photos about food for inspiration will also become aware of their recipes. People may find their way to their page just because of the visuals and might read recipes later. The significant advantage here is that instead of clicking through over 60 pages of lists about recipes and travelogues that have already been written, in Pinterest, you only find the stringing together of photos for the matching post. Instagram also pursues a similar goal in terms of responsiveness. On top, both are not restrictive in language, meaning photos can reach an international audience to come visit the site for once.

Twitter and Instagram are particularly well suited for interaction. There, the owner shows herself as the person behind the blog. She strengthens the personal bond between herself and her followers by talking about unique things in comments without bringing them into a direct connection with the interaction on the blog. However, the exchange is exceptionally high.

In addition, she shares very personal things from her daily life on Twitter. Here you can also find content that has nothing in common with your blog. This is the perfect place for long-term supporters who don't want to miss anything from her. Political statements, family or everyday content, comments on friends' posts, or situations from TV or travel can be found here.

To all appearances, all process steps are carried out by her herself. She does not have considerable effort for her social media posts because, outside of Twitter, she only reuses material she has already worked out. Only the photos with a link to the blog and a short description are mainly spread.
