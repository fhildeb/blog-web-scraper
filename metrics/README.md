# Sample Blog Metrics

> **_NOTE:_** Picture description appears in German.

### Timeframe of analytics:

`2nd December 2019 - 27th December 2019`

All metrics and research has been done for the sample blog mentioned in the project's main folder. Roughly half of the blog's metrics are directly derived from the scraped data within the `/data` folder.

## Key Points

Those are directly calculated from scraped data:

- Conversation Rate in `Comments per Post`: 9,75
- Outcome in `Post per Month`: 6,38
- Content Created in `Words per Post`: 880,58

## Blog Value

According to the website [WorthOfWeb](https://www.worthofweb.com/), the blog [Kuechenchaotin](https://kuechenchaotin.de/) is worth 4.281 USD. On the part of [WEBUKA](https://www.webuka.com/), it's only 2,162 USD, according to [WebsiteOutlook](https://www.websiteoutlook.com/), a whole 3,960 USD, pointing at around 3,500 USD on average.

For a blog created in 2012 and with the density of posts, it is a good value but far below what other blogs are worth. The blog [EatThis](https://www.eat-this.org/), to which the sample blog links within the blogroll, was created in 2011 and is even worth 14,650 USD, according to [WebsiteOutlook](https://www.websiteoutlook.com/). This is due to paid search queries and campaigns against which the sample blog has spoken out.

## Applied Business Models

The blog owner offers collaborations in the following forms:

- Sponsored posts and product placements
- Show cooking and lectures at trade fairs and events
- Culinary recipe, event, and travel reviews
- Social media takeovers
- Food and travel photo and video productions
- Recipe developments for companies
- Columns and productions for external magazines
- Production of websites and blogs

Placing ads, in the sense of Google AdSense, the owner does not do. However, personal ads of her books and other reference blogs, within posts, are on her website. Likewise, there is a listing of blogs that she directly promotes, a so-called "blogroll" of the site. Furthermore, there are sponsored posts from time to time. If we look at the target hierarchy, it covers direct sales in the areas of "own market ads," "collaborations," and "affiliate links."

According to the blog's statements, the following things are not used:

- SEO-only collaborations, link purchases, and link exchanges.
- Publications of guest articles or press releases
- Affiliate cooperations
- Collaborations without labeling, etc.
- Non-traditional sales

In her blog section, where the owner talks about the willingness to collaborate, she also sets conditions and boundaries. Collaborations are all meant to support her principle of "maintaining authenticity." If she doesn't find a fair use for the blog or can't identify with the collaboration, it doesn't happen. She includes a link to her books on every page, representing the point of "selling products" in the target hierarchy. So this turnover comes only indirectly through the blog.
